    <Question QuestionID="1">
      <Description>If you're not already doing so, I'd recommend braking a little earlier for the turns. Aside from that, changes to Brake Pressure or Brake Bias may also help. We can either look at increasing the Brake Pressure to improve braking power, or we can shift the Brake Bias. We can look at increasing Brake Pressure, which will make them more powerful. Or decrease ABS which holds the brake pressure longer per interval, but can increase chance of lock-up.</Description>

    </Question>
    <Question QuestionID="2">
      <Description>Generally speaking, stopping too quickly can be an advantage, as it means you can brake later to gain more time. We can, however, lower the Braking Pressure or increase ABS, this means that the brakes will have less stopping power,  but it will also reduce the chance of locking-up the tyres.</Description>

    </Question>
    <Question QuestionID="3">
      <Description>Ok, this sounds as if you're locking the tyres under braking, which is then causing the car to slide. Can you tell me whether it's the front or rear wheels that are locking-up? If it's the front locking-up, you'll find your car wants to keep going straight while you're braking, and you can't turn into the corner. If it's the rear, then the back of the car will get unstable and try to spin around. If all wheels lock up at the same time, you can consider increasing ABS, this will reduce lockups, however it does increase braking distance.</Description>

      </Answer>
    </Question>
    <Question QuestionID="4">
      <Description>Are the front tyres locking easily? For instance, do they lock up almost straight away when you get on the brakes? If so, we can decrease the Brake Pressure, this will make the brakes a little less powerful, but will give you finer control under braking, and will also reduce the chance of the tyres locking-up. Or alternatively, we can move the Brake Bias towards the rear a little so the front brakes work a little less. This should ease the likelihood of the front brakes from locking.</Description>

        <Description>Bottoms out at high speed.</Description>
      </Answer>
    </Question>
    <Question QuestionID="1">
      <Description>Ok, if you feel you're too slow on the straights, it could mean that the wing angles, or parts creating downforce, are too high and are creating too much drag. We can lower the rear wing angle, the front downforce angles, or both, if they are present, to create less drag and increase top-end speed. This could have an effect on car balance though, potentially increasing oversteer if only lowering the rears downforce, or understeer if only adjusting the front. Alternatively, you can take a look at the car's Gearing to see if you can get a little more straight line speed that way. If you want to improve this area I'd advise taking a look at Gearing as that might help you get a little more straight line speed.</Description>

    <Question QuestionID="2">
      <Description>Ok, if it feels as if  you're losing grip at the rear through fast turns, that could mean that the rear wing angle is too low and not generating enough rear Downforce, which is causing oversteer.It is also possible you are bottoming out throughout the corner, causing the floor to starve and lose downforce, in this case increasing the rideheight can help. You can also look at the Suspension, as that could provide alternative solutions to this problem.</Description>

    <Question QuestionID="3">
      <Description>Ok, if you feel as if the car isn't turning into corners, in all likelihood you're suffering from understeer. We can increase the front wing, or splitter angle, which will give you more front Downforce and "bite". That could mean that the rear Downdorce is too high and is causing too much drag, Would you like us to lower it for you? This will cost you downforce on the rear of the car in the corners.</Description>

    </Question>
    <Question QuestionID="2">
      <Description>Ok, it sounds as if you're getting understeer when turning in. There are a couple of things we can do here. First, we can stiffen the front springs to make the car more responsive when turning in. The other thing we can do depends on whether or not you're bottoming-out. If you're not, we can lower the front ride height to generate a bit more front downforce for those faster corners. We can stiffen the front Spring Rates to provide a bit sharper steering. Increasing the bumpstop range allows for more weight transfer during braking and turn in at heavy braking corners.</Description>

    <Question QuestionID="3">
      <Description>Ok, so you feel as if you're getting understeer, or push, mid-turn. Let's stiffen the rear Anti-Roll Bar. This should help stop the rear from rolling around as much, and will also generate a little more rotation in the turn. We can stiffen the rear Anti-Roll Bar for you which should stop the back from rolling around as much and generating a little more rotation from the car in the turn. Alternatively it is possible the weight slowly tranfers onto the rear wheels with soft bumpstop rates, causing it to roll and raise the front end during a corner.</Description>

      <Description>Ok, firstly i'd advise taking a look at the tyre pressures as well as compounds in the setup section. Adjusting the tyre pressures, and selecting a more durable compound, can help with tyre wear. We can also try to stiffening the spring rates a little, which will make the tyres work less.</Description>

    <Question QuestionID="10">
      <Description>When you need to brake heavily for a corner, it is possible the weight transfers too much to the front the front end bottoms out, decreasing the bumpstop range prevents the front going lower than a certain point. Alternatively the pitching needs to go smoothly, if the front hits the bumpstop too fast the energy will transfer to the tyres, causing too bounce. Increasing the bumpstop rate with smooth this out.</Description>
